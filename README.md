# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe made in LibGdx 

My first almost game (in the current situation it is far from the game) is made in libgdx. It is very basic and I am hoping someone will contribute to this and improve it. 

# TODOS
    - To make it more colorful and improve some graphics
    - To improve AI
    - To improve target detection, sometimes when we click on center target/center box of the grid, it places the O/X in other adjoining cells.
    - To make it more fun
    - To improve text rendering
